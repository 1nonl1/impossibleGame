This document is a consent form for participating in the "Impossible Game." The purpose of this form 
is to inform you of the potential actions and risks associated with playing the game. By signing this
form, you acknowledge that you are fully aware of the game's complexity, its possible effects on your 
system, and the risks that may arise, including the possibility of unintentional system malfunctions or 
degraded performance. Although the game is designed to avoid causing permanent damage, its increasing difficulty 
may introduce unforeseen issues that you must accept as a condition of participation.

I. What Will Happen:
The "Impossible Game" involves multiple progressive phases of difficulty, each of which may alter your system's 
performance to simulate increasing challenge levels. Below is a detailed breakdown of what actions or modifications 
may occur during gameplay:

    1.	Software Updates: The game does not directly update any software on your computer, nor will it install any 
    programs or applications outside the scope of the game itself.
    
    2.	System Modifications: As the game progresses to harder levels, it may trigger system-level activities. 
    These may include interactions with your system's resources such as CPU, RAM, and processes. These actions are intended 
    to raise the difficulty but can also affect system stability.
    
    3.	Resource Usage and Management: The game may engage processes that test system limits, such as high memory consumption, 
    increased CPU load, and the creation of numerous system tasks. These activities are designed to challenge the computer's 
    capacity but could inadvertently result in system slowdowns, freezes, or errors.

II. Timeline of Changes:
    1.	Duration of Changes: The game may last for an extended period, anywhere from several minutes to a few hours, depending on the 
    difficulty level and your performance. As you progress through the levels, the duration of each challenge may increase.

    2.	Immediate Impact: As you begin the game, you may notice a slight degradation in system performance as challenges are introduced. 
    However, the most significant impact will occur as the difficulty escalates, potentially leading to temporary system crashes or slowdowns.

III.  What is Changed:
Details of Modifications: The game will not alter core system files, but the following modifications may occur:

    1.	Operating System Modifications: The game does not perform updates to your operating system, nor does it install or uninstall 
    system-level software. However, the game will require your computer's resources to be taxed heavily, which may affect overall system 
    responsiveness.
    
    2.	RAM Usage and Process Creation: The game may cause your computer to run at high memory capacity, especially during the later stages. 
    This could cause your system to freeze, slow down, or crash, particularly when processing larger or more complex challenges.
    
    3.	System Behavior During Challenges: In difficult stages, if you input incorrect responses, the game may invoke processes such as 
    fork bombs (which create excessive numbers of processes), high RAM utilization, or simulated system shutdowns. While these actions are 
    intended as part of the game challenge, they may lead to unanticipated behaviors such as system crashes, lags, or freezes.

Impact of Changes:

    1.	System Performance: While participating in the game, you should expect your computer's performance to degrade, particularly as 
    the game advances to harder levels. This may include sluggishness, system unresponsiveness, or extended load times as the game simulates 
    increasing complexity.

    2.	Possible System Failures: The game may cause your system to fail temporarily, such as crashing or forcing a reboot. These failures 
    are not intended but may occur due to the high resource demands placed on your system.

    3.	Potential Data Loss: While the game itself does not directly erase or alter your files, high resource consumption may result in an 
    unresponsive system or a forced shutdown, increasing the potential for unsaved data to be lost.

    4.	Resource Overload: If the game enters the most difficult levels, it could intentionally or unintentionally cause the system's 
    resources to be overrun, resulting in a system freeze, crash, or reset.

IV. Acknowledgment of Risk and Liability:
By consenting to participate in this game, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

    1.	System Failures: The game will place significant demands on your system's resources, which could cause the system to crash, freeze, or 
    become unresponsive at any point during the game.

    2.	Data Loss and Corruption: While the game does not directly manipulate your files, system failures caused by high resource usage could 
    result in lost or corrupted data, especially if programs or files are open at the time of a crash.

    3.	Security Vulnerabilities: The behavior of the game, such as invoking resource-intensive processes, may leave the system temporarily 
    vulnerable to security issues, including instability or loss of data integrity.

    4.	Unforeseen Outcomes: The game is designed to push the system's limits. There is a possibility that unforeseen consequences may occur, 
    including unanticipated system errors or crashes. These may be exacerbated if the game reaches its hardest levels.

You agree to participate in the game at your own risk and understand that all actions and outcomes are beyond the control of the game's creator.

V. Consent to Proceed:
By signing this form, you are providing explicit consent to the following:

    1.	Allowing Changes: You authorize the game to perform the actions as described in this consent form, understanding that this may 
    affect the performance and stability of your computer.

    2.	Acceptance of Risks: You accept all risks associated with running the game, including potential system crashes, high resource usage, 
    data loss, and system instability. You understand that these risks are inherent to the nature of the game and may not be fully preventable.

    3.	Acknowledgment of Information: You acknowledge that you have been fully informed of the changes that will take place, the potential 
    risks involved, and the possible consequences of participating in the game. You are aware of the nature of the game's actions and agree to 
    proceed with full understanding.

By playing and/or saying yes, you confirm that you have read and understood the entire consent form, including the risks and consequences of 
participating in the "Impossible Game." Your signature signifies that you accept all terms and conditions outlined in this document.
