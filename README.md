If you choose to play the Hard version of the game YOU MUST READ THE CONSENT FORM!!

The impossibleGame is a game in python terminal, geared towards people who have a good amount of knowledge with cybersecurity, encryption, and steganography.
PLEASE DON'T READ THE SCRIPT!! It makes the game not as fun.
